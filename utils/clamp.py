val = clamp(val,minVal,maxVal)
---------------------------------------

Clamp the variable "val" between [minVal maxVal]
if minVal = [] : no lower bound
if maxVal = [] : no upper bound

Inputs:
  val          Input coregistered Multi-Plane data
  minVal       Minimum boundary
  maxVal       Maximum boundary

Outputs:
  val        	Clampped value
