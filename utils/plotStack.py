plotStack(data,figID)
-------------------------
Opens a basic gui that allows simplified navigation through 3D data stacks
if figID is specified, first close(figID), then create figure(figID)
if figID is not specified, open a new figure

Inputs:
   data        Data stack [X Y Z]
   figID       Figure ID,  if set, close(figID),then create figure(figID)
                           if not set, open new figure

Outputs:
   s           Structure containing experimental and processing parameters
